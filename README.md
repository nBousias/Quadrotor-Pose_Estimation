# Quadrotor-Pose_Estimation

Code solves the problem of estimating the pose of a flying robotic platform using information obtained from its onboard sensors, i.e. an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an onboard stereo pair, using the complementary filter to estimate the orientation of the platform and a stereo odometry algorithm to estimate the position and orientation of the platform over time. The algorithms are applied on real data acquired by a quadrotor platform (EuRoc dataset collected at ETH
Zurich).

This project was conducted for the purposes of MEAM-620 (project 2.1) at Upenn.
